    "1. **Import Libraries**: \r\n",
    "    ```python\r\n",
    "    import sys, numpy as np\r\n",
    "    from keras.datasets import mnist\r\n",
    "    ```\r\n",
    "    - `sys`: Standard Python library for accessing the Python runtime environment.\r\n",
    "    - `numpy as np`: NumPy library for numerical operations.\r\n",
    "    - `mnist from keras.datasets`: Importing the MNIST dataset from Keras.\r\n",
    "    - `About the data`:  \r\n",
    "      Before importing the data from MNIST, the data is already in matrix format. In Keras and many other machine learning libraries,  \r\n",
    "      datasets like MNIST are usually stored in a format that is easy to load into memory as NumPy arrays or similar data structures.  \r\n",
    "      This allows for quick and efficient manipulation of the data, which is essential for machine learning tasks.  \r\n",
    "      It is quite common for machine learning datasets to be distributed in formats that are immediately usable for model training, such as NumPy arrays, CSV files, or other specialized formats.  \r\n",
    "      However, in some cases, especially in custom projects or when working with new datasets, you might have to deal with raw image files (.png, .jpg, etc.) or other types of unstructured data.  \r\n",
    "      In such cases, you would use image processing libraries like PIL or OpenCV in Python to read the image files and convert them into NumPy arrays.  \r\n",
    "      Additionally, you might perform other preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, or data augmentation, before using the data for training a machine learning model.  \r\n",
    "      So while mature datasets often come preprocessed and ready-to-use, real-world projects may require you to handle the rawdata yourself.\r\n",
    "tf.\r\n",
    "\n",
    "      rself.\n",
    "2. **Load Data**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This line loads the MNIST dataset, separating it into training and test sets for both images (`x_train`, `x_test`) and labels (`y_train`, `y_test`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preprocess Images and Labels**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    images, labels = (x_train[0:1000].reshape(1000,28*28) / 255, y_train[0:1000])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Only the first 1000 images and labels are used.\n",
    "    - Images are reshaped from 28x28 to a flat vector of 28*28=784.\n",
    "    - Pixel values are normalized by dividing by 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **One-hot Encoding for Labels**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    one_hot_labels = np.zeros((len(labels),10))\n",
    "    for i,l in enumerate(labels):\n",
    "        one_hot_labels[i][l] = 1\n",
    "    labels = one_hot_labels\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Labels are converted to one-hot encoding. E.g., label 2 becomes [0,0,1,0,...,0].\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Preprocess Test Images and Labels**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    test_images = x_test.reshape(len(x_test),28*28) / 255\n",
    "    test_labels = np.zeros((len(y_test),10))\n",
    "    for i,l in enumerate(y_test):\n",
    "        test_labels[i][l] = 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Similar preprocessing is done for the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Initialize Parameters and Hyperparameters**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    np.random.seed(1)\n",
    "    relu = lambda x:(x>=0) * x \n",
    "    relu2deriv = lambda x: x>=0 \n",
    "    alpha, iterations, hidden_size, pixels_per_image, num_labels = (0.005, 350, 40, 784, 10)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Random seed set for reproducibility.\n",
    "    - Two lambda functions defined for ReLU and its derivative.\n",
    "    - Hyperparameters like learning rate (`alpha`), number of iterations, hidden layer size, etc., are initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Initialize Weights**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    weights_0_1 = 0.2*np.random.random((pixels_per_image,hidden_size)) - 0.1\n",
    "    weights_1_2 = 0.2*np.random.random((hidden_size,num_labels)) - 0.1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Weights for the connections between input and hidden layer (weights_0_1), and between hidden and output layer (weights_1_2) are initialized.\n",
    "\n"
